# Lightweight Lexer Written in Rust 

This project is experimentation on a programming language I am planing to write. Also I wanted to learn the fundamentals of **Rust Language**. 
*NOTE: This is a lexer. Not a lexer generator*    

## Possible Future Modifications 

 - First of all create a lexer that recognizes more than numbers and keywords.
 - async support for parsing. ( parsing can start in paralel while lexing a long file)
 - An interface for a dynamic lexer generator(might be an alternative project)
